Welcome to Code Canvas! This blog serves as a playground for me to experiment
with ideas and share some of my findings. It's a reflection of my career path and
interests - especially on the technical side of things. For more information, check
out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayesh-cholkar-845057254/).

I am proficient in Javascript, React JS, Node JS, Next JS, Nest JS and Python. My current interests are in the areas of
full-stack development, Genrative AI, technology and labour economics so expect
to see more of these stuff in the future! This blog is bootstrapped from the awesome
[Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog Template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
(coincidentally written by me). Source code for the website is available at my
[Github page](https://github.com/timlrx/timlrx.com).

Highlights - check out my analysis on migration and food consumption which I have
written up as part of my masters thesis [slides available here](/static/mig_cons_slides/index.html) or
preview the [Singapore economy dashboard](/dashboard/sg-dashboard.html). For a
more technical read check out how to [create a custom cross-validation function in pyspark](/blog/creating-a-custom-cross-validation-function-in-pyspark)
or my thoughts on [using DAGs in causal inference](/blog/applications-of-dags-in-causal-inference)
